# Overview

Open the attached web page (index.html). Your task is to code the `.hero` section
as follows:

* The header text should be set to 50px and white
* There should be 100px of space to the top and bottom of the hero
* There are three hero images in the `images` folder. Use `small.jpg` as the background up to
768px wide, `medium.jpg` up to 960px wide and `large.jpg` above 960px wide.
* The background image should cover the entire height and width of the hero container.
* The background image should have a green overlay (#468C00) at 50% opacity. This
overlay should go on top of the image but not the text.
* By default, the image will load from the top down. We want to hide the image until
it's downloaded and then fade it in. The fade should take 1 second to complete.

The end result will look something like this:

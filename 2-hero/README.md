# Overview

Open the attached web page (index.html). Your task is to code the `.hero` section
as follows:

* The header text should be set to 50px.
* There should be 100px above and below the text.
* There are three hero images in the `images` folder. Use `small.jpg` as the background up to
768px wide, `medium.jpg` up to 960px wide and `large.jpg` above 960px wide.
* The background image should cover the entire height and width of the hero container.
* The background image should have a green overlay (#468C00) at 50% opacity. This
overlay should go on top of the image but not the text.
* By default, JPGs load from the top down which doesn't make for a smooth presentation.
Hide the image until it's downloaded and then fade it in. The fade
should take 1 second to complete. Fading the image in should not affect the height
of the hero container.

The end result will look something like this:

#O3 Front End Development Exercises

## Instructions

- **Layout**: Fix the layout so both columns fit side-by-side. Retain the existing padding around each column. 
- **Responsive**: Make this static page responsive. Attempt to make the design fit at any screen size. Below 480px wide, make the layout match the wireframe (see mobile-wireframe.pdf). 
- **Markup**: Print the image. Label each element in the image with the HTML element you would use to mark it up. Be as detailed as possible.

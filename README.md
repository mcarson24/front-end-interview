#O3 Front End Development Exercises

## Remote Exercises

#### Instructions

**Responsive Implementation**: Make this static page responsive. Attempt to make the design fit at any screen size. Below 480px wide, make the layout match the wireframe (see mobile-wireframe.pdf). 

#### Distribution

The zip file contains the base HTML, CSS, images and mobile wireframes. Send the candidate the zip file and instructions above. Ask the candidate to post their completed work on their github repo. 

#### Evaluation Criteria

- Changing the pixel widths to percentages (how did they handle the math?)
- Did they do anything special for large screens or just small?
- Did they attempt to use a responsive images solution? Or did they just resize the existing images?
- How did they implement the mobile menu and hamburger icon?
- Did they use a framework? Did they ask about which frameworks they can use? 
- Did they test it? (To make sure it actually works, and find things like missing meta tags.)

# Overview

Open the attached web page (index.html). Your task is to update the layout
as follows:

1. Below 768px wide, each section should fill the width of the browser. The
   content should be ordered as follows: `.header`, `.content`, `.navigation`,
   `.sidebar` and `.footer`.

2. At 768px wide and above, the layout should shift to a 3 column design. The
   `.header` comes first and is 100% wide. The `.navigation`, `.content` and
   `.sidebar` all sit side-by-side in that order. The `.sidebar` should be
   fixed at 200px wide, the `.content` should take up 75% of the remaining
   space, the `.navigation` should take up 25% of the remaining space. The  
   three side-by-side sections should be equal height. The `.footer` comes last
   and should be 100% wide.

3. Finally, the design should never exceed 1200px wide and it should be
   centered within the browser window. Page content should always
   be aligned to the left.

4. Your solution should work in Chrome and Firefox.

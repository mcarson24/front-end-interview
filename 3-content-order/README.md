# Overview

Open the attached web page (index.html). Your task is to update the layout
as follows:

1. Below 768px wide, each section should fill the width of the browser. The
   content should be ordered as follows: `.header`, `.content`, `.navigation`,
   `.sidebar` and `.footer`.

2. At 768px wide and above, the layout should shift to a 3 column design. The
   `.header` comes first and is 100% wide. The `.navigation`, `.content` and
   `.sidebar` all sit side-by-side in that order. The `.navigation` should be
   fixed at 200px wide and the `.content` should take up 75% of the remaining
   space. These three sections should be equal height. The `.footer` comes last
   and should be 100% wide.

3. Finally, the page sections should never exceed 1200px wide and it should be
   centered within the browser window although page content should
   be aligned to the left.

Your solution should work in Chrome and Firefox at a minimum.
